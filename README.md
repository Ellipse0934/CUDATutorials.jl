# CUDATutorials.jl

This package intends to host a variety of tutorials on GPU programming in Julia using the CUDA platform. Currently the package is under active development as a part of Google Season of Docs. If you have ideas or suggestions please feel free to reach out at julialang slack/zulip #GPU channel or by opening an issue here.

The first month's content will focus on introducing the GPU programming model and simple uses for inexperienced beginners(Assume no experience). We will then focus on other specific applications such as [SciMl](https://github.com/SciML) and [Images.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages) after which we will reevaluate and decide what to do for the remainder of time. Considering that Julia's GPU programming paradigms are going to be largely platform agnostic there shouldn't be much trouble porting most of the work here to other platforms such as AMD and Intel in the future.
