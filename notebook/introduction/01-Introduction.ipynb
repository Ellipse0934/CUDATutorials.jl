Modern GPU's are commonly called GPGPU (general purpose GPU) which shows their importance in scientific computation alongside graphics.\n",

    "[Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines(BLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) are subroutines for Linear Algebra operations. Linear algebra's importance in scientific computing makes BLAS essential to GPU computing. One of the most primitive BLAS operations is to scale a vector and add it to another vector. Given two vectors ($x$ and $y$) and a scalar ($\\alpha$) we add $\\alpha\\cdot x$ to $y$. In BLAS libraries this manifests as the functions SAXPY, DAXPY and CAXPY. The difference between the three is that the data type of the vectors is `Float32`, `Float64` and `Complex{Float32}` respectively. However in this example we call our subroutine `axpy` and let Julia take care of the types."

    "Consider parallelization on a CPU with `p` processors. We can divide our arrays into `p` subarrays of equal size and assign a processor to each subarray. This can theoretically make our parallel version `p` times faster. We say \"theoretically\" because there is an overhead of starting threads and synchronizing them. Our hope in parallel computing is that the cost will get amortized with the speedup of parallelization, but that may not be the case. Which is why measuring performance is extremely important. Nevertheless, the parallel version asymptotically scales linearly w.r.t `p` which is really good, so much so that these types of problems are classified as \"embarassingly parallel\". In other cases when processors need to communicate and synchronize frquently the benefit does not scale linearly with the number of processors.\n",

    "#### Measuring Time\n",
    "Since the primary inspiration for parallel programming is performance it is important to measure it effectively. Because the CPU and GPU can execute asynchronously there some nuance in their profiling. When we launch a CUDA kernel using `@cuda` after the kernel is launched, control is immediately returned back to the CPU. The CPU can continue executing other code until it's forced to synchronize with the GPU. Certain events like memory transfers and kernel launches can force synchronization. While measuring time and benchmarking we need to force synchronization otherwise we are measuring the time to launch kernels rather than the time it took to execute on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two simple ways to force synchronization are to use the `CUDA.@sync ex` where the CPU is blocked until `ex` finishes execution. The other is to use `CUDA.@time` which synchronizes before and after `ex`. Using `CUDA.@sync` is advisable when using a benchmarking package like [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl). Example `@benchmark CUDA.@sync ex`\n",
